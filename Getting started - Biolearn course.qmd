## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

The point of this document is to document the set up for starting the Biolearn project. To get started I did the following

1.  Opened a new github repo in my github account.

2.  Opened this project as a New Project within Posit using the open from a github rep option.

3.  Copy and pasted the github repo url to initiate the project

4.  Generated a personal access token following these directions

    <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens>

5.  Stored the PAT in a notepad document on my computer and in the PAT file in this project. This is needed to connect to the repo when oushing and pulling.
